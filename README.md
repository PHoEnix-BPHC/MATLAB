# **MATLAB WORKSHOP**

## SUMMARY

1. **UNIT OF STUDY**: MATLAB
2. **OBJECTIVE** : Teach the basic concepts of MATLAB to prepare students for 2nd
    year courses.
3. **INSTRUCTOR** : Avinash Bhat and Raghuram C S
4. **TIME** : 5-6 hrs divided into 3 interactive live sessions.

## WHAT IS MATLAB?

MATLAB is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers and scientists to
analyze and design systems and products that transform our world. The heart of MATLAB
is the MATLAB language, a matrix-based language allowing the most natural expression
of computational mathematics.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH MATLAB?
It is a language used for:
● Analyzing Data
● Developing Algorithms
● Creating Models and Applications

MATLAB lets you take your ideas from research to production by deploying to enterprise
applications and embedded devices, as well as integrating with Simulink and
Model-Based Design.

## SCOPE OF THE COURSE
The course is designed to cover the basics of MATLAB and Simulink coupled with a
project which will give a hands-on experience for the course taker to design and simulate
signal and image processing systems and control systems by capturing algorithms and
system models. The course will aim to make the student proficient at using multiple
facilities of MATLAB and Simulink like Built-in functions, algorithms ,etc. for analyzing
signals. **Taught in SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS : CDC for PHoEnix**

## COURSE PLAN
Look in the handout pdf uploaded.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
MATLAB and Simulink (Mathworks products) have free students’ licenses for a few
universities. If you are unable to download large files, you may use the online version of
MATLAB, and Xcos instead of Simulink.

## MATERIAL AND RESOURCES
Resources corresponding to the topics covered in each class would be provided as the
course goes on for better understanding and further reading.

## ASSESSMENT
A Certificate of Participation will be awarded to participants who attend the sessions and
complete the beginner tasks assigned. At the end of the course, a project assignment will
be released in the last session , which will be the metric for leaderboard consideration. A
Certificate of Merit will be awarded based on the assignments submitted by the course taken.
